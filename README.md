# AI Seminar Summer Semester 2025 at Leuphana University of LÃ¼neburg, Germany

To provide guidance to students who may be new to development, here is a sequence of topics the students should learn to develop a working project.

1. **Learn Git**  
   You will use Git to maintain your code, so the first step is to learn this tool.  
   - [GitHub Guides](https://github.com/git-guides)  
   - [Git for Computer Scientists (more advanced)](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/)

2. **Learn Python**  
   - [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)  
   - Make sure you do all Python development in a virtual environment: [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
  
2.5. **Learn LangChain and RAG**  
   - [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/)
   - [RAG] (https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/rag/)
   - [PDF-Document-QA] (https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/pdf_qa/)

3. **Understand the Concept of Full-Stack Development**  
   - [Full-Stack Development Basics](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/full-stack-development)

4. **Learn about REST APIs**  
   - [REST API Examples](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/)

5. **Learn the Flask Framework (or Node.js) (OPTIONAL, see 8)**  
   Flask is a Python-based framework for handling backend APIs. It's easier if you already know Python. If you're more comfortable with JavaScript, Node.js is a good alternative.  
   - [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)  
   - [Node.js Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)

6. **Learn a Web Frontend Framework (OPTIONAL, see 8)**  
   - [HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)  
   - [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)  
   - [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)  
   - [React Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp)  
   - [Bootstrap Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ver.asp)

7. **Learn a Database**  
   - [Choosing the Right Database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-choose-the-right-database-for-your-application/)  
   - Decide between SQL and NoSQL. You may also need a Graph database.

8. **Alternative to 5 and 6: Learn Streamlit**  
   Streamlit combines frontend and backend into a single Python framework, but it offers less flexibility. **I recommend this framework for this course to save time.**  
   - [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials)

9. **Learn Deployment and Packaging with Docker and Docker Compose**  
   - [Docker Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

10. **Learn SCRUM for Project Management**   
    - [Trello Guide](https://trello.com/guide)


My last tip is, use ChatGPT to understand topics in more depth. I have found it to be very effective in these topics, and can also produce for you code and templates which you can use directly in your projects.
